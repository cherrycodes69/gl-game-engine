# GL Game Engine

GL Game Engine is an archived open-source game engine. While it's not cutting-edge or groundbreaking, it serves as a reference and starting point for enthusiasts and students of game development.

## Features

- Uses OpenGL for rendering.
- **Entity-Component System**: For managing game objects and their behaviors.
- **3D Collision & Bounce Behavior**: Allows for simulation of object interactions in a 3D space.
- **Optimized Collision Checks**: Incorporates optimizations that divide the search space in 3D, enabling collision checks only within the vicinity of each object, reducing computational overhead.
